# Cache Management

`nflreadpy.clear_cache` clears cached responses generated by the downloader and
betting ingestion services. Call it without arguments to purge the entire cache
or supply a pattern to remove matching entries.

```python
import nflreadpy as nfl

# Clear everything
nfl.clear_cache()

# Remove only play-by-play entries
nfl.clear_cache(pattern="pbp")
```

Entries are matched using substring checks against cache keys. The cache manager
supports both in-memory and filesystem backends; clearing the cache removes the
relevant files or dictionary entries immediately.
