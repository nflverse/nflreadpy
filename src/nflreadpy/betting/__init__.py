"""Sports betting analytics toolkit built on top of :mod:`nflreadpy` data access.

This module exposes high level orchestrators for the Bloomberg-style NFL
betting platform requested in ``AGENTS.md``.  It wires together the
asynchronous sportsbook scrapers, data ingestion layer, Monte Carlo
simulation engine, analytical edge detection utilities, and a lightweight
terminal dashboard for monitoring opportunities in near real-time.

The subpackages are intentionally granular so that researchers can extend
or swap components – for example, by registering new scrapers or
specialised simulation models – without rewriting the rest of the stack.
