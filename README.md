A Python package for downloading NFL data from nflverse repositories. This is a
Python port of the popular R package [nflreadr](https://github.com/nflverse/nflreadr),
designed to provide easy access to NFL data with caching, progress tracking, and
modern Python conventions.

## Features

- Compatible API with nflreadr R package
- Fast data loading with Polars DataFrames
- Intelligent caching (memory or filesystem)
- Progress tracking for large downloads

## Documentation

Browse the full documentation at [nflreadpy.nflverse.com](https://nflreadpy.nflverse.com) for API
reference material, operational guides, and extension patterns.

## Install

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv add nflreadpy

# Using pip
pip install nflreadpy
```

## Usage

```python
import nflreadpy as nfl

# Load current season play-by-play data
pbp = nfl.load_pbp()

# Load player game-level stats for multiple seasons
player_stats = nfl.load_player_stats([2022, 2023])

# Load all available team level stats
team_stats = nfl.load_team_stats(seasons=True)

# nflreadpy uses Polars instead of pandas. Convert to pandas if needed:
pbp_pandas = pbp.to_pandas()
```

### Experimental betting analytics toolkit

The repository now ships with a Bloomberg-style research stack focused on
NFL betting.  The entry point lives under ``nflreadpy.betting`` and
provides:

* **Asynchronous sportsbook scrapers** – the ``MockSportsbookScraper``
  simulates line movement while concrete scraper subclasses can target
  live operators.
* **Persistent ingestion pipeline** – ``OddsIngestionService`` coordinates
  scrapers and stores quotes in SQLite for historical analysis.
* **Monte Carlo engine** – ``MonteCarloEngine`` uses Poisson scoring models
  to derive win probabilities, margin/total distributions, and team-scoped
  scoring curves across full game, half, and quarter scopes.
* **Edge detection and bankroll sizing** – ``EdgeDetector`` compares model
  probabilities with market prices and applies a Kelly sizing heuristic.
* **Terminal dashboard** – ``Dashboard`` renders simulations and edge
  opportunities in a Bloomberg-inspired ASCII layout for quick situational
  awareness.
* **Multi-book aggregation & normalisation** – ``MultiScraperCoordinator``
  stitches together asynchronous scrapers while ``NameNormalizer`` aligns
  teams, players, and sportsbook identifiers across feeds.
* **Line movement & portfolio analytics** – ``LineMovementAnalyzer`` surfaces
  steam, while ``PortfolioManager`` constrains exposure per market and
  bankroll.
* **Quantum-inspired allocator** – ``QuantumPortfolioOptimizer`` samples a
  soft-quantum amplitude distribution to prioritise edges for further review.
* **Command line harness** – ``python -m nflreadpy.betting.cli`` runs the full
  ingestion → modeling → edge detection loop with portfolio recommendations and
  movement summaries.

Official container images for the betting stack are published to
`ghcr.io/nflverse/nflreadpy` with ``-cpu`` and ``-gpu`` tags. Each image ships with the betting
extras installed and uses ``nflreadpy-betting`` as the entrypoint so you can run commands such as:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e NFLREADPY_BETTING_ENV=production \
  -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config \
  ghcr.io/nflverse/nflreadpy:latest-cpu ingest --interval 60 --jitter 5
```

Comprehensive documentation for the betting toolkit lives on the docs site:

- [User guide](docs/guides/user-guide.md)
- [Developer guide](docs/guides/developer-guide.md)
- [Operations guide](docs/guides/operations.md)
- [Platform setup](https://nflreadpy.nflverse.com/guides/setup/)
- [Configuration reference](https://nflreadpy.nflverse.com/guides/configuration/)
- [CLI command reference](https://nflreadpy.nflverse.com/guides/cli/)
- [Dashboard operations](https://nflreadpy.nflverse.com/guides/dashboards/)
- [Extension points](https://nflreadpy.nflverse.com/guides/extension-points/)

Quotes are normalised into the rich schema requested in ``AGENTS.md``:

``(book_market_group, market, scope, team_or_player, side, line, american_odds, extra)``

and cover mainlines, alternate ladders, quarter/half splits, and player
props (including either-player composites).  The probability layer supports
moneylines, spreads, totals, team totals, alt ladders, leader markets, combo
props, and prop tails via a combination of Monte Carlo distributions and
lightweight player models.  Mock scrapers emit winner 3-way, reception ladders,
player combo props, and leader markets to exercise the richer schema.

See ``tests/betting/test_betting_stack.py`` for an end-to-end example of
gluing the modules together without accessing external sportsbooks.
