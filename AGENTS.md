Prompt for Advanced Sports Betting Tool
Analysis of the nflreadpy Repository
Overview: The nflreadpy repository (maintained by the NFLverse community) is a comprehensive
Python library for accessing NFL data. It emerged as a modern replacement for older data providers (like
nfl_data_py ) to ensure up-to-date coverage for current seasons . The library’s design emphasizes
ease of data access, caching for performance, and broad coverage of NFL-related datasets. It focuses on
retrieving and preparing data (schedules, stats, play-by-play, etc.) rather than modeling or predictions.
Below, we break down the codebase architecture, key modules, data pipeline, and supported NFL data, as
well as the library’s extensibility.
Architecture and Key Modules
nflreadpy is organized into modular components, each handling a piece of the data access pipeline:
Configuration: The config.py module defines a Pydantic-based configuration class
( NflreadpyConfig ) with environment-variable overrides . Users can configure cache mode
(memory, filesystem, or off), cache directory, cache duration (default 24h), verbosity, request
timeout, and user-agent string . This makes the library flexible to different runtime needs
(e.g. enabling verbose download logs or adjusting timeouts). Global config is accessible via
get_config() and modifiable via update_config() .
Caching: The library provides an intelligent caching layer in cache.py . The CacheManager class
supports in-memory caching (for quick repeat access) and on-disk caching (for persistence across
sessions) . It automatically checks the cache before making network requests and stores
results after downloads. Cache keys are derived from the data URL and parameters (using an MD5
hash) . The cache respects an expiration duration (default 86400 sec) – if data is older, it’s re-
fetched . Users can clear cache entries globally or by pattern (e.g. clear all entries for
“pbp_2023”) . This caching system ensures that after an initial data pull (which might take tens of
seconds), subsequent uses load almost instantly from cache .
Downloader: The downloader.py module defines NflverseDownloader , which manages HTTP
requests to fetch data files . It has a map of base URLs for various data sources (e.g., nflverse-
data on GitHub releases, espnscrapeR-data , dynastyprocess , etc.) . The downloader
constructs the full file URL based on repository and path, appending the appropriate file extension
(Parquet or CSV) . When download() is called, it first checks the cache (via a global
CacheManager ) and returns cached data if available . If not cached, it streams the file from
GitHub (using Python requests with a user-agent from config) and reads it into a Polars
DataFrame (Parquet or CSV parsed accordingly) . The result is then stored in cache for reuse

. This design abstracts away the raw URLs – calling functions don’t need to know where data is
hosted, as the downloader handles it.
Data Load Functions: The core of nflreadpy is a collection of load_* functions, each in its own
module under src/nflreadpy/ . These functions cover specific NFL datasets and use the
downloader to fetch data. For example, load_pbp.py provides load_pbp() to retrieve play-by-
play data , and load_stats.py provides load_player_stats() and
load_team_stats() for weekly player and team statistics . There are many such functions
(detailed in Supported Data below), each typically performing: (1) parameter handling (seasons or
other filters), (2) calling get_downloader().download() with the appropriate repository and file
path, (3) possibly filtering the returned DataFrame by seasons or other criteria, and then returning a
Polars DataFrame. The modules also include utility functions; e.g., utils_date.py defines
get_current_season() and get_current_week() to determine the current NFL season and
week based on today’s date (with proper logic for when a new season/year starts) .
Overall, the codebase follows a clean separation: configuration & caching (for performance), a downloader
(for data access), and many loader functions (for each dataset). This separation makes it easy to maintain
and extend—adding a new dataset is as straightforward as writing a new load_xyz() that specifies the
source file and uses the existing downloader/cache infrastructure.
Data Pipeline and Workflow
The typical data pipeline using nflreadpy is as follows :
Function Call: A user calls a nflreadpy.load_* function for the data they need. For instance,
nfl.load_schedules(seasons=True) to get all schedule data, or
nfl.load_player_stats([2024, 2025], summary_level="week") for weekly player stats in
2024-2025.
Parameter Handling: The function interprets the parameters. Most allow a season (int or list), a
boolean True meaning “all available seasons,” or None meaning current season . For
example, load_pbp(seasons=True) will internally set the season list to 1999 through the current
season , whereas passing a specific year or list just uses those. This logic includes validation
to avoid out-of-range requests (e.g., ensuring a season is between 1999 and current year for play-by-
play) .
Data Download: The loader function calls
get_downloader().download(repo, path, format, **kwargs) . The repository and path
are hard-coded for each dataset. For instance:
Play-by-play calls download("nflverse-data", "pbp/play_by_play_<season>", ...) in a
loop for each season requested .
Schedules call download("nfldata", "games", format=CSV) once to get a master games CSV
.

Player stats use a helper _load_stats internally which likely calls
download("nflverse-data", "player_stats_<summary_level>", ...) or similar .
The downloader checks cache first. If a cached Parquet/CSV for that URL exists and is fresh (within
cache_duration ), it returns it immediately . If not, it makes an HTTP GET to the GitHub URL,
optionally showing a tqdm progress bar for large files if verbose mode is on . The content is then
read by Polars ( pl.read_parquet or pl.read_csv ) into a DataFrame . After loading, the
DataFrame is saved to cache (in-memory dictionary or on disk as a Parquet file) for next time .
Post-processing: In some cases, the loader function will then filter or transform the data:
Combining multiple years: If multiple seasons were loaded (resulting in a list of DataFrames), it
concatenates them into one Polars DataFrame .
Filtering by season: For datasets delivered as a single file containing all seasons (e.g. schedules, or
combine data), the function filters the DataFrame by the requested season list .
Cleaning data: Some functions apply cleaning to match R’s nflreadr output. For example,
load_schedules() cleans the roof field values to a set of valid categories (dome/outdoors/etc)
and sets others to None (mirroring the behavior in R).
Validation: While most validation (like ensuring no missing critical fields) is left to user code or the
data source, the library does include basic sanity checks via exceptions (e.g., invalid season range
raises ValueError ).
Return: Finally, the Polars DataFrame is returned to the user. Polars is used for its speed and
memory efficiency on large datasets (like two decades of play-by-play). Users can convert to pandas
easily ( df.to_pandas() ) if needed – indeed, some downstream tools wrap nflreadpy and
convert to pandas for compatibility .
Thanks to caching and the use of efficient formats (Parquet), this pipeline is optimized. The first call for a
dataset will download potentially large files (e.g., all play-by-play since 1999 is a sizable Parquet), but
subsequent calls are much faster. For example, one project noted the first data load took 30–60 seconds,
whereas subsequent loads from the cache completed in under 1 second .
Supported NFL Data and Current Coverage
One of nflreadpy ’s strengths is its comprehensive coverage of NFL data . It wraps many datasets
maintained by the NFLverse community and others, providing a single interface to access them. At the time
of analysis, it supports the following NFL data (with current availability):
Game Schedules & Results: load_schedules() returns the NFL schedule with results and
metadata for each game . By default it loads all available seasons (passing seasons=True ) ,
pulling from a master “games” dataset. This includes basic game info (teams, scores) and context like
the betting closing lines (point spread, total) for each game . The schedule data covers past
seasons and current/upcoming games; e.g. as of 2025 it includes games through 2025 .
Play-by-Play (PBP): load_pbp() loads detailed play-by-play data for games . This is available
from 1999 onward (matching the nflfastR dataset). Users can request a specific year, a list of years, or
all years (1999–present) . The returned DataFrame contains every play with rich details (down,

distance, yard line, play type, players involved, EPA, etc.). This data is essential for deep analysis and
is the largest dataset provided. Thanks to Polars, even concatenating decades of PBP is manageable.
Player Stats: load_player_stats(seasons, summary_level) provides aggregated player
statistics. The summary_level can be “week”, “reg” (season totals), “post” (postseason), or
combined . For example, at weekly level, this function returns all player performances per
week (rushing, passing, receiving stats, etc.). This data is typically from the NFLverse repository and
includes extensive offensive stats and possibly defensive stats.
Team Stats: load_team_stats(seasons, summary_level) gives team-level statistics in a
similar fashion . This could include team totals per game or season (offensive yards,
defensive metrics, efficiency like EPA per play, etc.), allowing modeling of team strength. Both player
and team stats cover recent seasons (likely 1999+ for offense; possibly more limited for advanced
stats depending on source). The user documentation indicates 102 statistical columns for team-
game records in the 2023–2025 range , which suggests rich detail.
Rosters: There are two roster-related functions. load_rosters() provides full team rosters for
given season(s), listing every player on each team . Data is available historically (the library
can pull all rosters back to 1920 if requested, using seasons=True which loads 1920–present) .
It returns one row per player-season with attributes like team, position, etc.
load_rosters_weekly() (as listed in the docs) likely gives weekly roster snapshots or practice
squad elevations, though it’s a more specialized dataset (perhaps from 2018 onward when available).
Snap Counts: load_snap_counts() fetches data on snap counts (how many snaps each player
was on the field in each game) . This data, sourced from Pro-Football-Reference, is available
from 2012 onward . It includes offensive and defensive snap counts and snap percentages for
each player in each game – vital for understanding player usage.
Next Gen Stats (NGS): load_nextgen_stats(stat_type, seasons) provides advanced player
tracking metrics from NFL Next Gen Stats . The stat_type can be "passing", "receiving", or
"rushing", and data is available from 2016 onward . These datasets include cutting-edge
metrics like passer aggressiveness, receiver separation, rushing efficiency, etc., as provided by NGS.
The function loads all seasons since 2016 by default and filters by the requested years .
FTN Charting Data: load_ftn_charting(seasons) gives detailed play charting data from an
external source (FTN) for 2022 onward . This likely includes manually charted info (coverages,
alignments, etc.). The library pulls each season’s data file and concatenates if multiple years are
requested .
Participation Data: load_participation(seasons) returns player participation logs (who
participated in each play, often from Gamebooks or scouts) from 2016 onward . This
complements snap counts by detailing specific play involvement.
Draft Picks: load_draft_picks() returns NFL draft data (all drafted players and their details) for
all seasons (historically) . This likely covers rounds, pick numbers, college info, etc., by year. Since
draft data isn’t extremely large, it’s probably loaded in full and filtered if needed.

Injuries: load_injuries(seasons) provides injury reports data . This may include weekly
injury status for players (likely sourced from official injury reports or a community dataset). The
availability might span recent years (the R version had weekly injuries from 2009+). The library will
fetch all or specific seasons as requested.
Contracts: load_contracts() returns historical contract data . This could be data from
OverTheCap or Spotrac compiled by the community, listing player contracts, cap hits, etc. It comes as
a single dataset (no season parameter, as contracts are cumulative/historical).
Officials: load_officials(seasons) provides data on NFL game officials (referees, umpire, etc.
assignments) . This data covers seasons from 2015 onward . The function grabs the full
officials dataset and filters it to the requested years . Analysts can use this to see referee
crews for games.
Combine: load_combine(seasons) fetches NFL Scouting Combine results . It loads all
combine data (historically all years) and filters by year if needed . Fields include player
measurements and drill results (40-yard dash, bench press, etc.) .
Depth Charts: load_depth_charts(seasons) returns team depth charts by season .
Depth charts are available starting 2001 . If no season is given, it defaults to current; if True, it
loads all 2001–present. This data shows players’ positions in the depth chart hierarchy for each team.
Trades: load_trades() provides a dataset of NFL trades , presumably all recorded trades
(who was traded, when, for what picks/players). There’s no season filter (it likely includes all historical
trades in one file) .
Fantasy Football Data: The library also integrates some fantasy football-centric data:
load_ff_playerids() gives a comprehensive mapping of player IDs across fantasy platforms
(DynastyProcess database), bridging different data sources’ player identifiers .
load_ff_rankings(type) loads fantasy expert consensus rankings or projections, where type
can be “draft”, “week”, or “all” for historical . It pulls data from DynastyProcess’s repository
(either as CSV or RDS conversion) .
load_ff_opportunity(seasons, stat_type, model_version) provides data on opportunity
metrics (like expected fantasy points, target share) from the ffopportunity project . Users can
specify stat_type “weekly” or play-by-play level, and choose the model version (latest by default)
. This helps fantasy analysts quantify player usage and efficiency.
Current NFL Support: As of the 2025 season, nflreadpy is actively maintained and supports the latest
data. For example, it includes 2023–2025 schedules and recent team stats . The NFLverse community
keeps the underlying data (like the nflverse-data repo) updated regularly during the season ,
meaning new weeks’ stats or play-by-play are added soon after games. This library can fetch those updates
as soon as they’re published, making it very suitable for current-season analysis. The built-in logic for
“current season” detection uses date rules (e.g., after Labor Day for season start, after mid-March for roster
year) , ensuring that calling load_*() with no season or None automatically targets the ongoing
season/year.

In summary, nflreadpy provides one-stop access to a wide array of NFL data – from traditional stats
and schedules to advanced metrics and administrative data – all through a unified interface. Its data
pipeline efficiently downloads and caches this information, yielding fast performance for repeated use. The
library does not include machine learning models or predictive algorithms itself; instead, it serves as the
data foundation on which users can build models (e.g., win probability models) and simulations. The focus
is on data completeness and reliability (for instance, ensuring no critical fields are missing and realistic
distributions like home win rate ).
Simulation Capabilities and Models
nflreadpy does not contain built-in simulation engines or predictive models – it is purely a data
retrieval library. There are no functions for simulating games or computing win probabilities; instead, it
provides the detailed data that a user could feed into their own simulation logic or machine learning
models. For example, one could use play-by-play data from nflreadpy to run a custom Monte Carlo
simulation of a game, but that would be implemented outside the library (as evidenced by external scripts
that use nflreadpy data for simulations) . The repository’s focus is to remain a data source. All
“models” referenced in the context of nflreadpy are data models (tables of information), not predictive
models.
That said, the rich datasets it provides (and the fact it’s up-to-date) make it invaluable for simulation and
modeling efforts. Users can quickly get the latest stats, then use their own algorithms to, say, simulate the
rest of the season or calculate win probabilities for upcoming games. The design choice to use Polars
DataFrames underscores that it expects potentially large-scale usage (Polars can handle bigger-than-
memory datasets and is optimized in Rust). The library leaves analysis and modeling to the user, ensuring it
stays general-purpose.
Extensibility and Maintenance
nflreadpy is built with extensibility in mind:
Adding New Data: Because each dataset corresponds to a fairly self-contained function and uses a
common downloader, adding support for a new data source is straightforward. For instance, if the
NFLverse community releases a new dataset (say, advanced offensive line stats), one could add a
load_offensive_line_stats() that calls downloader.download() with the appropriate
repository and path. The caching and config systems would automatically support it. The library’s
clear separation of concerns (each dataset in its own module) means new code won’t tangle with
existing logic.
Updating Data Sources: The base URLs for data are configurable in the downloader . If a data
source moves or changes format, updating the BASE_URLS or adjusting a function’s file extension
from Parquet to CSV is trivial. This decoupling from any one format (the library can read both
Parquet and CSV, and even R’s RDS is handled by providing CSV alternatives as noted for some FF
data ) makes it robust to changes.
Caching Options: Users can easily turn caching off or switch to file caching via config if they plan to
integrate nflreadpy into a larger system with its own cache or database. The use of environment
variables for config also allows system-wide defaults to be set (e.g., setting
97

•

NFLREADPY_CACHE_DIR for a shared cache location). This flexibility makes it easier to slot
nflreadpy into various environments (from local scripts to cloud functions).
Community and Maintenance: As an NFLverse project, nflreadpy benefits from community
contributions and is regularly updated. It’s maintained alongside the R counterpart ( nflreadr ),
ensuring feature parity and data consistency across languages. The documentation references (like
data dictionaries and reference URLs ) indicate alignment with the R package, which means
improvements or new data added in one often propagate to the other. The repository is likely
versioned (v0.1.0 as minimum in requirements ), and as the 2025 season progresses, new
releases will come out to fix bugs or support new columns.
In conclusion, nflreadpy provides a solid architectural foundation for NFL data access: it’s
comprehensive, efficient, and extensible. Its current NFL data support spans everything from basic schedules
to granular play data and modern analytics, all accessible through a simple Python API. This makes it an
ideal backbone for any NFL analytics or betting project, where one needs reliable and current data.
Codex Prompt for a Bloomberg-Terminal-Style Sports Betting Tool
Using the capabilities of nflreadpy as a data foundation, we now envision a highly sophisticated sports
betting analysis tool. This tool will function akin to a “Bloomberg Terminal” for sports bettors –
aggregating real-time data, running advanced simulations, and presenting actionable insights with
professional rigor. Below is a Codex-ready software development prompt that could be given to an AI like
OpenAI Codex (or GPT-4) to implement such a system. The prompt is formulated to ensure the AI follows a
chain-of-thought approach in planning and executing the task, maintains self-consistency in its reasoning
, and adheres to prompt engineering best practices for clarity and completeness.
System Role: You are an expert Python developer and data scientist specializing in sports analytics and
high-frequency trading systems. You have extensive knowledge of NFL data, sports betting markets,
advanced statistical modeling (including quantum algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations), and modern
software architecture design. You will design and implement a professional-grade, fully automated sports
betting analysis tool with a focus on NFL football.
Task: Build a comprehensive Bloomberg Terminal-style sports betting application for NFL data. The
software must automatically collect, analyze, and present betting insights in real-time. The system should
be designed with modular components and emphasize extreme complexity, precision, and integration
across data sources, simulations, and user interface. It will run on a personal computer (no cloud
dependency beyond accessing data feeds), utilizing only WiFi internet for data retrieval. The tool should
continuously update itself with the latest information and provide a rich interactive dashboard for the user.
Requirements and Features:
Data Ingestion – Real-Time Odds Scraping: Develop a module to scrape live odds from multiple
online sportsbooks in real-time. This includes point spreads, moneylines, totals, and player prop
lines across various markets. The scraper should:

Connect to sportsbooks’ public odds APIs or parse HTML from their websites (ensure compliance
with any usage terms).
Aggregate odds from at least e.g. 5 major sportsbooks, updating on a frequent interval (e.g. every
minute) to capture line movements.
Parse different bet types (game outcome, player props, etc.) and normalize the data into a common
format. For example, ensure team names and market names are standardized.
Be robust to connection issues or site changes – implement error handling, retries, and possibly
fallbacks (mirror sources).
Automation: This module runs continuously in the background, fetching odds without user
intervention. It triggers updates to downstream analysis whenever new data arrives.
(Implement this as a standalone Python class or service, so it can be started/stopped independently.
Use asynchronous requests or multithreading to handle multiple sources concurrently.)
Data Ingestion – Static and Historical Data: Leverage nflreadpy (and other data providers if
needed) to pull historical data and live stats for context:
Use nflreadpy to load recent and historical game data (team stats, player stats, play-by-play) as
needed for modeling . This ensures the tool has a rich dataset for making predictions (e.g., team
performance metrics, player averages, etc.).
Fetch any additional data not covered by nflreadpy (if required), such as real-time player injuries
or weather updates, via public APIs.
All data fetching should be automated and self-updating. For example, schedule a daily data refresh
for any stats that update overnight (or use push updates if available).
Maintain a local cache or database of historical data to avoid repeated heavy downloads. (You can
utilize nflreadpy caching or implement a custom persistence layer, e.g., a SQLite database for
odds history and simulation results.)
Quantitative Modeling Engine: Create a modeling module that uses advanced probabilistic and
statistical methods (including quantum-inspired algorithms) to analyze the data:
Implement a Monte Carlo simulation engine that can run millions of simulations for a given game
or scenario. For example, simulate an NFL game play-by-play or outcome distributions millions of
times to estimate win probabilities and score distributions. Utilize efficient libraries (numpy/pandas/
polars, or even C/C++ extensions) and parallelism to achieve a high simulation count quickly.
Incorporate quantum computing concepts or advanced algorithms for probability if possible
(e.g., use pseudo-random number generators with quantum entropy, or quantum-inspired
optimization for certain betting portfolio choices). While actual quantum computing might be out of
scope on a PC, design the module in a way that it can plug into advanced algorithms that mimic
quantum annealing for optimizing betting strategies.
The models should output expected values (EV) for each bet, win probabilities, and confidence
intervals. For instance, given the distribution of simulation outcomes for a game’s point total,
calculate the probability that the total goes over a sportsbook’s line and the EV of betting the over or
under.
Use Chain-of-Thought in code: break down the modeling into clear steps (e.g., input processing,
simulation, result aggregation, then EV calculation) and comment each step explaining the rationale.
This will help ensure clarity and facilitate debugging.

Implement self-consistency checks: for critical calculations, run them in multiple ways or multiple
times to verify stability. For example, run two independent simulation seeds – if results diverge
beyond a tolerance, flag it or increase simulation runs. This approach, analogous to performing
multiple reasoning paths and aggregating results , will increase confidence in the model’s
outputs.
Undervalued Line Detection: Build a component that automatically identifies undervalued
betting lines:
After each simulation and EV calculation, compare the model’s implied probabilities vs the
sportsbook odds. For example, if the model says Team A has a 60% chance to win but a sportsbook’s
moneyline implies only a 45% chance, that line is undervalued.
Calculate Kelly Criterion bet sizing for each identified edge, to suggest how much to wager relative
to bankroll, if this were an automated betting strategy.
Rank and prioritize the opportunities by highest EV or largest probability discrepancy. Include
thresholds to filter out opportunities with negligible edges (to avoid noise).
This module should run automatically whenever odds update or simulations refresh, continually
scanning for edges. It essentially serves as an “alert system” highlighting the best bets at any
moment.
Architecture & Integration: Design the software in a modular, extensible architecture:
Scraper Module (Odds Engine): as described, provides live odds feed.
Data Module: for historical data and context (could wrap around nflreadpy usage).
Simulation/Model Module: runs the probability models and simulations.
Analytics Module: responsible for computing EV, identifying edges, and perhaps portfolio
optimization (if multiple bets are worth taking, how to distribute capital).
Dashboard UI Module: described below, for user interface. These modules should communicate
through well-defined interfaces or data flows. For example, the Scraper feeds odds into the Analytics
module, which then triggers the Simulation module for any games with significant changes.
Ensure the system can be easily extended to other sports or additional metrics. For instance, design
the odds scraping in a sport-agnostic way where adding a new sport is a matter of specifying new
endpoints and simulation rules.
Use object-oriented design or a plugin system such that each sportsbook’s scraper is a class (making
it easy to add/remove sources), and each type of analysis (spread vs prop) can be handled by
appropriate classes or functions.
User Interface – Interactive Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard (could be a web app or
a desktop GUI) that displays the results in real time:
Show a market watch panel similar to a stock ticker: live odds from each tracked sportsbook for
upcoming games, updating continuously.
Display recommended bets with details: e.g., “Bet Team A +3.5 at OddsXYZ sportsbook – Model win
probability 64% (EV = +8.5%)”. Include confidence intervals or risk metrics for each recommendation.

Provide the ability to drill down into a game: if a user clicks a game, show simulation details –
distributions of scores, key stats from the simulations, etc., possibly with visualizations (charts of
probability distributions, etc.).
Include alerts or highlights on the dashboard for lines that meet certain criteria (e.g., colored
indicators for high EV opportunities or if a line has moved significantly in the last 5 minutes).
The dashboard should update in near real-time as new odds come in or new simulations run. Use a
framework suitable for live updates (for a web app, maybe a combination of Flask/Django backend
with WebSocket or polling for updates, or a desktop app with an async event loop).
Ensure the UI is user-friendly and professional: this is a premium tool, so design with clean
aesthetics, organized layout (like Bloomberg Terminal with panels/windows), and possibly
customization options (user can choose which games or markets to monitor).
Additional Considerations:
Performance & Scalability: Running millions of simulations and scraping multiple sites can be CPU
and I/O intensive. Optimize by using efficient algorithms, parallel processing (multi-threading or
multi-processing for simulations; async I/O for scraping), and possibly C/C++ extensions or
vectorized numpy operations for heavy computations. Ensure the application remains responsive by
managing workloads (e.g., stagger simulations or use background worker threads).
Accuracy & Precision: Given the use of advanced models, ensure numerical stability. Use double
precision for probability calculations. Where applicable, incorporate techniques like variance
reduction in simulations to improve confidence in results for a given number of iterations.
Self-Monitoring: Implement logging throughout the system to track actions (data fetched,
simulations run, bets identified) and any anomalies (e.g., scraper failures, model exceptions). The
tool could even have a diagnostic panel in the UI for these logs.
Extensibility: The code should be written in a clean, modular way with plenty of comments and
documentation. For example, someone else should be able to extend the simulation module to
another sport or add a new analysis metric by following the structure. Use clear class and function
interfaces. Where possible, utilize configuration files or a small DSL for things like which sportsbooks
to scrape, which markets to simulate, etc., so changes don’t require altering code.
Inspiration from Finance: The system’s design can draw on principles from financial trading
systems (as in BloombergGPT’s domain specialization and reliability in finance ). For instance,
treat each bet opportunity like a financial instrument – the tool should be as rigorous and fast in
evaluating a bet as a trading algorithm evaluating a stock. Incorporate fail-safes and sanity checks
akin to risk management in trading (e.g., don’t recommend bets with extremely low liquidity or stale
lines).
Testing: Write unit tests for each module (e.g., test that the scraper correctly parses known sample
HTML/JSON from sportsbooks, test that the simulation returns reasonable results for a simple known
scenario, etc.). Also include integration tests simulating the full flow (perhaps with recorded odds
data) to ensure the components work together properly.
Approach: Begin by laying out the project structure and class designs for each module (Scraper, Simulation,
Analytics, UI, etc.). Use a step-by-step, chain-of-thought approach to plan the implementation: for each
major component, outline the sub-tasks and how they will be solved. Then proceed to implement in code,
writing clear comments explaining each step. Maintain self-consistency by double-checking outputs of
critical functions (for example, after running a simulation, cross-verify one or two scenarios by an analytical
calculation to ensure the simulation makes sense).

Throughout development, adhere to prompt engineering best practices for the AI: tackle one component at
a time, reason about edge cases, and keep the bigger integration picture in mind. This structured approach
will result in a robust, complex system that meets the requirements.
This prompt explicitly details what the software should do and how it should be structured, guiding the AI
through a careful planning and building process. It integrates chain-of-thought reasoning (by
encouraging stepwise breakdown and thorough commenting) and self-consistency (by recommending
multiple checks and approaches to ensure reliability) . It also incorporates best practices from prompt
engineering literature – providing a clear role, detailed instructions, and a structured list of requirements
– to maximize the chances of obtaining a high-quality, correct solution. The architecture draws
inspiration from domain-specific financial systems like Bloomberg’s, emphasizing accuracy and real-time
performance in a specialized domain . By following this prompt, a coding-focused LLM (Codex/
GPT-4) should be able to generate a blueprint and substantial code for a state-of-the-art sports betting
analysis tool that is fully automated, extremely sophisticated, and ready to give bettors a decisive edge.
