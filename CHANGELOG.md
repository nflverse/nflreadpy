# nflreadpy (devel version)

Changes:

* load_teams() now points to nflverse-data@teams for compat with nflreadr (breaking change)
* load_schedules() now points to nflverse-data@schedules to access parquet version of file
* load_trades() now points to nflverse-data@trades to access parquet version of file

Betting module notes live in [`betting/CHANGELOG.md`](betting/CHANGELOG.md) so
that sportsbook-specific updates do not crowd the core package entries.
